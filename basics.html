    <p>First, we need to learn some basics</p> <!-- always in the body -->

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels.</p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>Unordered lists use the "ul" tag:</p>
    <ul> <!-- should never contain anything other than <li> tags -->
      <li>Add a "ul" element</li>
      <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
      <li><p>Other tags, like paragraph tags ("p"), are fine to be wrapped inside "li" tags though</p></li>
      <li>They're not ordered in any specific way</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is an ordered list:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Item 1!</li>
      <li>The "ol" tag wraps everything</li>
      <li>Notice the order</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
    <p>So far, we've covered block elements (aka "flow content"). Another major type
       of content is the inline element, or "phrasing content". These are treated
       differently and can affect sections of text anywhere within a line.
    </p>

    <p><em>Somtimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.
    This can be done with the "em" tag, which <em>em</em>phasized the "sometimes".
    </p>

    <p>Or, maybe you want to <strong>bold</strong> something. That's facilitated with
    the "strong" tag. Bold and italicized are possible like <strong><em>this</em></strong>,
    by using multiple nested inline elements.
    </p>

    <p>Now, let's be clear: while "bold" is the action, it's not the correct term. The correct term
    is the term in the tag: strong. This is a difference between HTML and CSS. HTML will provide
    the semantic structure, while CSS will provide presentation information.
