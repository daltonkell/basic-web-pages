    opening tag. The attribute name comes first, then the equal sign, then the "value" of the attribute in either
    single or double quotes. This syntax distginuishes attributes from content, which goes between the tags.
    The info provided by the href attribute tells the browser that the &lta&gt element is a link, and should render
    its content in default blue text.
