    <h1>Links</h1>
    <!-- The anchor tag, <a>, alters the meaning of text just like any other tag. It's
    another example of an inline element. -->
    <p>This example is about links and <a>images</a>. Now, rendered, the
    &lta&gt element on its own doesn't do much. However, there are things we can add...
    </p>

    <h3>Attributes of Elements</h3>
    <p>Elements have different attributes, and we can refer to the Mozilla Developer docs
    for listings of elements and their attributes. Right now, we're concerned with the <em>href</em>
    attribute because it determines where the user goes with then click an &lta&gt element. Updated link:
    </p>

    <p>This example is about links and <a href="images.html">images</a>. Now, attributes live inside the
    opening tag. The attribute name comes first, then the equal sign, then the "value" of the attribute in either
    single or double quotes. This syntax distginuishes attributes from content, which goes between the tags.
    The info provided by the href attribute tells the browser that the &lta&gt element is a link, and should render
    its content in default blue text.
    </p>

    <p>This particular page is about links! There are three types of links:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Absolute links, like to
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">Mozilla Developer Network</a>, which is a very good resource
           for web development stuff.
        <p>It's possible to use absolute links to refer to pages in your own website, but hard-coding
           your domain everywhere can make for some tricky situations. It's usually a better idea to reserve absolute links
           for directing users to a different website.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>Relative links, like to our <a href="misc/extras.html">extras page</a>.
        <p>Now, there are relative links called "root-relative links". Instead of being relative to the current</br>
           directory, they are relative to the root of the project. They look like so:
           </br>
           &lta href='/'&gthome page&lt/a&gt
           </br>
           These aren't particularly applicable right now, but are super useful in terms of actual web pages when we have a real server.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Link Targets</h3>
    <p>Attributes alter the meaning of HTML elements, and sometimes you need to modify more than one</br>
       aspect of an element. For example, the &lta&gt tag also accepts a "target" attribute, which defines</br>
       where to display the page when the user clicks a link. By defauly, most browsers replace the current page</br>
       with the new one. We can use the "target" attribute to as the browser to open a link in a new window/tab.</br>
       </br>
       Let's try changing the absolute link we have above to open the page in a new tab:</br>
       </br>
       <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank">Mozilla Developer Network</a></br>
       </br>
       Read more about this <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>
       
    <h3>Naming Conventions</h3>
    <p>Basically, just make sure to follow the same naming conventions that programming languages use in general for files.
    </p>

    <p>Now, head to the <a href="images.html">images page</a> to check out stuff for images
