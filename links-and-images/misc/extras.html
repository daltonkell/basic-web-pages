    <h1>Extras</h1>
    <p>This page is about miscellaneous HTML things, but you may be interested in <a href="../links.html">links</a> or
       <a href="../images.html">images</a>. The relative paths provided in the href (&lta href="../images.html"&gtimages&lt/a&gt)
       are relative to the current directory -- so make sure you've got your directories in order!
       </br>
       In fact, all the images in this tutorial will be loaded with relative URLs. This allows us to rename any of our chapter
       slugs (what's a slug?) without having to update all our image paths.
