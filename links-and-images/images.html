    <h1>Images</h1>
    <p>Unlink all the HTML elements we've encountered this far, image content is defined <em>outside</em> of the web pages</br>
       that render it. We refer to these external resources by using any of the above paths.</br>
       </br>
       Images are included in web pages with the &ltimg/&gt tag and it "src" (source) attribute, which points to the image</br>
       you want to display. Notice how it's an "empty" element, like &lt/br&gt:</br>
       </br>
       &ltimg src="some-photo.png"/&gt</br>
       </br>
       We won't put this in our project just yet -- still need to discuss a few things first.</br>
       </br>

       Retina displays and mobile devices make it a little more complex to handle images than the old</br>
       img tag. We'll leave these complexities till a later discussion.</br>
    </p>

    <h3>Image Formats</h3>
    <p>There are four main image formats used on the web:</br>
       <ul>
         <li>.jpg: Handle large color palettes without bloating size; good for photos with</br>
             lots of colors, gradients. They do <em>not</em>allow transparent pixels, so that's a bummer.</br>
           <img src="images/mochi.jpg"/>   
         </li>
         <li>.gif: go-to option for simple animations; limited in terms of color palettes, so never use them</br>
              for photos.</br>
           <img src="images/mochi.gif"/>
         </li>
         <li>.png: great for stuff that isn't a photo and isn't animated (icons, technical diagrams, logos). Bigger than .jpg</br>
           <img src="images/mochi.png"/>
         </li>
         <li>.svg: "scalable vector graphic"--scalable to any dimension without loss of quality. Phenomenal resource for responsive design.</br>
           <img src="images/mochi.svg"/>
         </li>

    <h3>Image Dimesions</h3>
    <p>By default, the img element uses the inherited dimensions of its image file. Our JPG, GIF, and PNG images are</br>
       actually 150x150, while our SVG is only 75x75. We'll dicsuss this later, but pixel-based image formats need to be</br>
       twice as big as you want them to appear on retina displays. To get our pixel-based images down to the intended</br>
       size, we can use the "width" attribute of the img tag:</br>
       </br>
           <img src="images/mochi.jpg" width="75"/>
       </br>
           <img src="images/mochi.gif" width="75"/>
       </br>
           <img src="images/mochi.png" width="75"/>
       </br>
           <img src="images/mochi.svg" width="75"/>
       </br>

       Setting the "width" attribute sets an explicit dimension for the image. There is also a corresponding "height"</br>
       attribute; setting only one will cause them to scale proportionately, but setting both will cause stretching.</br>
       Dimension values are specified in pixels, and you should never include the unit./<br>
       </br>
       The "width" and "height" attributes are useful, but it's usually better pratice to set image dimensions in CSS</br>
       so you can alter them with media queries. We'll get to that later.
    </p>

    <h3>Text Alternatives</h3>
    <p>Adding "alt" attributes to images is a best practice; it provides a text alternative to the image</br>
       being displayed. This has an impact on both search engines and users with text-only browsers.</br>
       </br>
       Here are the updated images using the "alt" attribute:</br>
       </br>
           <img src="images/mochi.jpg" width="75" alt="Mochi ball in a bubble"/>
       </br>
           <img src="images/mochi.gif" width="75" alt="Animated mochi"/>
       </br>
           <img src="images/mochi.png" width="75" alt="I really don't feel like typing anymore"/>
       </br>
           <img src="images/mochi.svg" width="75"/>
       </br>
    </p>

    <h2>More HTML Attributes</h2>
    <h3>Document Language</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>default language is defined by the "lang" attribute set at the top level &lthtml&gt element</li>
      <li>Set ours as English, as it is written in English (should be set for all pages)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Character Sets</h3>
    <p>Like UTF-8; specifies the encoding used (to be used?). Check out the "meta charset='UTF-8'" tag up top</br>
       (should be set for every page)
    </p>
