    <h1>Headings Are Block Elements</h1>

    <p>Paragraphs are blocks, too. <em>However</em>, &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;
       elements are not. They are <strong>inline</strong> elements.</p>

    <!-- invisible div to create space to preserve the margins of the p elements -->
    <div style="padding-top: 1px"></div>

    <p>Block elements define the flow of the HTML document, while inline elements
       do not.</p>

    <!-- So far, every HTML element we've seen lends meaning to the content it
    contains. Many times, though, we need generic boxes purely for the sake of
    styling a web page. That's what <div> and <span> are for.

    Both <div> and <span> are container elements that don't affect the semantic
    structure of an HTML page. They are able to be styled by CSS, though, which gives
    us additional tools to style the page. The only real difference between the
    <div> and <span> elements is that the former is for block-level content, and the
    latter for inline content. -->
